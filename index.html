title: Considerations for KLRD Website

<div class="one-column">

<h1>KLRD Site considerations</h1>
<p><strong>1. Rebuild site to better serve mobile devices.</strong></p>
<p>The site should “respond” to the user’s screen size, and adjust automatically so that all content fits. The website’s layout should be easy to navigate by finger taps. <em>Example: this website.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>2. Change layout of site to clarify order of importance.</strong></p>
<p>Change layout from three columns to two columns. Format all content for easy visual scanning. <em>Example: <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/layer-cake-pattern-scanning/">Nielsen Norman Group</a></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>3. Reduce reliance on PDFs.</strong></p>
<p>Improve accessibility by building more content in HTML. Clicking on links that result in PDF downloads still tends to surprise web users. Warn users about PDFs with every download URL. <br /><em>Example 1: Resize this website using CTRL+ or CTRL-. <br />Style example of PDF warning: <a href="#">Appropriations Report (PDF)</a></em><br />

<p><strong>4. Improve search feature, and search results.</strong></p>
<p>Most web users aren’t “browsers” — they’re motivated hunters with a pre-conceived result in mind. Search results and website navigation need to be useful tools that aid a visitor in bagging their bounty. Add filtering and sorting options; use categories and tags to organize content.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>5. Move to a template-based website or CMS.</strong></p>
<p>Bring more writers and website editors into the process of managing KLRD content. Limit access where needed; but bring more democracy into the process.</p> 
<p>A Content Management System, or CMS, is a great tool for separating a website’s content from its source code. </p>
