title: Considerations for KLRD Website
---
<h1>KLRD Site considerations</h1>
<p><strong>1. Rebuild site to better serve mobile devices.</strong></p>
<p>Site should "respond" to the user's screen size, and make all menus available without zooming.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>2. Change layout of site to clarify order of importance.</strong></p>
<p>Change from three major content columns to two columns - one for sub-menu, and one for content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>3. Reduce reliance on PDFs.</strong></p>
<p>HTML has more accessibility features than PDFs for screen reading.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>4. Improve search feature, and search results.</strong></p>
<p>Add filtering and sorting options; use categories and tags to organize content.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>5. Move to a template-based website or CMS.</strong></p>
<p>Manage content, encourage multiple writers and editors, democratize the website process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
