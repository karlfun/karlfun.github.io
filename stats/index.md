* 43% of the traffic is to HTML content, but this is using only 2% of the data bandwidth
* Conversely, 19% of the traffic is to PDF content, and this is using 87% of the bandwidth 
* One file, the Child Welfare Task Force Committee Report, was responsible for 3 GB of the bandwidth used, with 1,402 downloads
* Site visits:
  * 28,831 of the site visits to the website come from a direct link (bookmark or email), about 91%
  * 3,571 of the visits come from Google searches
  * 2,658 of the site visits come from Facebook
  * The next highest amount is 576, from a legislator's campaign site
* Epub documents have had minimal downloads, but more investigation into their stats might be necessary
